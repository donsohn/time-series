# time-series

Using time series I wanted to explore some predictive models and understand how things worked under the hood.  
To make it easier on myself I first explored using Facebook's Prophet, then subsequently with SARIMA.  Both methods would forecast trends and seasonality, which I was especially interested in observing for stock price x time.  
As bonus, I wanted to create visualization other than the plots I have normally been doing via Python libraries.  To that end I used Tableau Public which is Tableau's free offering for creating and sharing visualizations.

Steps:
- Sourcing stock prices with yfinance Python library.  
- Applied Facebook Prophet for time series prediction
- Applied SARIMA for time series prediction 
- Viz using Tableau Public
